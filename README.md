## My process

I began by reviewing both the desktop and mobile designs provided to begin thinking about how I would structure the HTML. I wanted it to be as semantic as possible and efficient as possible. I then reviewed the style guide and began to add to the CSS styles sheet the provided fonts, colors, and other style attributes. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was mainly a review of concepts and skills I have already used and put into practice on previous projects. I did however utilize css properties for the colors used in the project. For example

```css
:root {
    /* Colors */
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --lightGray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayishBlue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --darkBlue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue using more CSS properties in future projects, and create more utility classes for the purpose of readability.
